# Compeus

**Computer Systems State Maintenance Tool**

Compeus is a fast state maintenance tool coded in C/C++. 
The program can be used to prevent the occurrence of 
hibernation or sleep problems in computer systems and
improve the ability of a system administrator to operate
by saving time which otherwise would be lost when the 
system may be locked or got into a sleep state and
a password might be required to access the system.
The program can be useful when the user may not have the
required permissions to change the operating system
hibernation or sleep mode. You could argue, 
"I can do that with Windows", Sure, if you have 
the permissions, but what if your organization 
has taken those permissions away? 
That's where this program can help.

Nota Bene: I use this when I go for a coffee to prevent the system going into
sleep or lock mode :)
